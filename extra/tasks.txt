## Group 2: “A Hybrid WiFi/Bluetooth RSS Dataset with Application to Multilateration-Based Localization” ##

--> Three tasks taken from the following list are OK for completing the final assignment. Other relevant tasks suggested from the group can be also considered. 

List of Tasks:

T1) Perform a statistical characterization of the anchors' RSS values in terms of mean, median, variance, distribution, etc.

T2) Estimate the path loss and reference distance parameters by exploiting a Linear model formulation as described in [R1]

T3) Develop an estimator for the target localization based on the (Weighted) Linear Least Squares following the reference paper

T4) Develop alternative WLLS estimators following [R2];

T5) Develop an estimator for the target localization based on the Maximum Likelihood estimator;

T6) Compare the performance of the same estimator in different conditions: (i) BLT only, (ii) Wifi only, (iii) Fused measurements;
